## Brain Tumor Classification

## Introduction

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be benign or malignant. Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have significantly advanced medical imaging, enabling automated and accurate tumor classification.

This repository presents a Brain Tumor Classification project that utilizes deep learning models to classify brain tumors from MRI scans. The objective is to build a robust model that can differentiate between tumor types, aiding radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

## Project Overview

Dataset: Publicly available MRI datasets containing images labeled with different types of brain tumors.

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.

Frameworks Used: TensorFlow/Keras,OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

Features

Preprocessing: Image normalization, augmentation, and noise reduction.

Deep Learning Model: Implementation of CNN-based architectures (VGG19).

Visualization: Grad-CAM for explainability of model predictions.

Deployment: Model export and deployment using Flask or FastAPI.
